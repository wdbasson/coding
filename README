./dev		development directory

Main development directory contains a folder for each individual "package" being
developed. (A package comprises similar tools/modules.)

NOTE: As we progress (and establish a process of how packages are developed),
appropriate interim directories will be created to distinguish between
development phases, "packages" and everything else being developed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./tmp		temporary directory

Temporary directory to use while conceptualizing the directory structure
